C# Goal and Meditate - projects were created for Programming with Classes to demonstrate Inheritance and Polymorphism

Connect4 - came about when I heard that it was often used as a interview question. I suggested it as a final project to a friend. The night before it was due I sat down with him and found his code to be sloppy and disfunctional. That night, before midnight we knocked out the entire project from start to finish, completely scrapping the original. Erik designed the program and had the dream to finish it, I designed the program and indevidual functions bringing the concepts to life. He also played a very important role in debugging. 

Daily Problems - Though I'm busy with school, I thought the daily coding problems sounded fun. When I have less-busy days I'll drop them in this folder.
